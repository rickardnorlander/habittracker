# habittracker
Habit tracker is a small script that enables tracking and exporting of your HabitRPG history. It tracks when you check and uncheck dailies, todos, and checklists, as well as when you perform a positive or negative habit. 

The data can then be exported in json format.

For it to work you will need [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox users) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (Chrome users). Then [install the script](https://github.com/rickardnorlander/habittracker/raw/master/Habit_tracker.user.js)

Caveat: habittracker is heavily coupled to the habitrpg website structure, and could therefore easily break if they change anything.
